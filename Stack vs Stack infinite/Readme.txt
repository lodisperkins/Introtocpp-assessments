To load program double click the executable located in the Stack vs Stack Infinite foler named LAB00. 
Once the program has loaded the games main menu should appear.

Use the numpad to select the number that is the same as the number next to the option on the screen.

If either option 1 or option 2 is picked. The attack menu should appear.
 
Three options then appear on screen.
The attack option decrements the oppponents health a random amount.
The defend option raises the players defense, however their turn is ended after.
The view stats option dispplays the heros current health, attack power, and defense power.

To pick an action, use the num pad
to select a number that is the same as the number next to the option desired on screen.

If option 3 is picked, press any key to progress through the simulation.

After either modes are completed another options menu will appear. 
Press the q key to exit the program or the w key to play again





A problem with the program comes with attacking and defending.

If a characters attack is higher than the defending fighters current health the defending player recieves negative damage.

The program does not print to the console the fighters remaining health when they have been dealt an attack that sets their
health to zero.

It is possible to cause information in the attack menu to not display correctly if the player chooses the view stats option

These are the only known problems with the program, however it's possible there are more.
